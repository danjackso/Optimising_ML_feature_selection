# Optimising ML feature selection
Optimising ML feature selection with binary global optimisation and k-fold shuffling.

This python code uses the particle swarm binary global optimisation algorthim to optimise features in a dataset to maximise accuracy. Using a simple dataset on wine classification, it was found this method increased the accuracy of a decision tree classifer by 4.7% over using all features of the dataset.
